This file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive)
 in some order, with no integer repeated. Your task is to compute the number of 
 inversions in the file given, where the ith row of the file indicates the ith 
 entry of an array. Because of the large size of this array, you should 
 implement the fast divide-and-conquer algorithm covered in the video lectures.
